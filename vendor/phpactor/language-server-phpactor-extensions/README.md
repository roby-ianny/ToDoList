Language Server Phpactor Extensions
===================================

![CI](https://github.com/phpactor/language-server-phpactor-extensions/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

The Phpactor Language Server Extensions.

This macro package implements all Phpactor language server functionality based
on the generic [LanguageServer](https://github.com/phpactor/language-server)
package.

Usage
-----

This package is bundled with Phpactor.

Structure
---------

Each extension should be treated as a separate package, coupling only to what
is necessary. In the future, if it were desired, it should be possible to
break the packages out of this macro repository.

Documentation
-------------

For more information on the Phpactor Language Server implementation see the
[Phpactor LSP documentation](https://phpactor.github.io/phpactor/lsp.html).

Contributing
------------

This package is open source and welcomes contributions! Feel free to open a
pull request on this repository.

Support
-------

- Create an issue on the main [Phpactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor) repository.
- Join the `#phpactor` channel on the Slack [Symfony Devs](https://symfony.com/slack-invite) channel.
